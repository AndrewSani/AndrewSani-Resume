        </h1>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Andrew Sani is a first year Business Management major student at the University of California Riverside. Outside of school, he enjoys hiking with friends and family. Andrew was born in Monterey Park, California on 4 September 2002.His parents immigrated from Indonesia in the '90s and had two children. Growing up, Andrew participated in Boy Scouts of America for 5 years and attended a piano academy for 8 years. Additionally, Andrew would volunteer at his local food bank to assist in distributing food. Also, Andrew would volunteer at the local Metro Homeless Center and would assist in making food and other activities. Andrew attended Potrero Height Elementary and Macy Intermediate Middle School.  Andrew graduated from Schurr High School in Montebello, California. During his time in Schurr High School, he participated in multiple clubs and school organizations. Some clubs he participated include: Asian American Club, Food Club, Gaming Association, Photography club, and Wood Club. Some school organizations Andrew was a part of was Speech and Debate, Avid, California Scholarship Federation, National Honor Society, and Student Body Government. Andrew graduated top 5% of his class with honors and perfect attendance.
<br><br>

        Andrew Sani has a proven track record of success in administrative and supporting roles, most recently in his previous internship as a LA Metro team leader during Metroâ€™s Transportation Career Academy Program(TCAP). A highlight from his time there was when he proactively stepped in to coordinate multiple zoom meetings for his senior leaders and teammates this year. Andrew coordinated research for a group of 13 teammates, organized all the information into a single slideshow, and collaborated with his senior leaders to answer any questions his teammates had. Due to the positive feedback he received afterward, at the end of Metroâ€™s Transportation Career Academy Program, Andrew and his team were awarded second place for Metroâ€™s Signage and Environmental Graphic Designs (SEGD) Project.
<br><br>

        Additionally, Andrew has shown continued dedication with anything he participates in. Notably his participation in Speech and Debate during highschool. During his  junior year, he became a captain for the Speech and Debate team. However, a situation arose that changed his plans for that year and forced him to focus more on the team. The director of his team was fired unexpectedly and as a captain, he had to focus his efforts on keeping the team afloat. He made the team a big priority because he did not want the program to end and let down so many students that were part of it.  And it was because of this redirection of responsibility that he received grades that were less than his expectations. After a year in the Speech and Debate team, he was recruited to become a captain because he was very dedicated to the activity. As a captain, he worked with the novice members to help them improve their public speaking skills, which is a very rewarding feeling because he gets to witness the growth of their public speaking skills. He grew to befriend and guide them through their first years on the team. He became more confident in my leadership skills, my social skills and most importantly, myself.
